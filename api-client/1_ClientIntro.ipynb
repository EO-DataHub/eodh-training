    "As part of the EODH project, `pyeodh` has been created. This is a lightweight Python client for easy access to EODH APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "An API client is a software tool or library designed to simplify interactions between a user's application and an external API (Application Programming Interface). In the case of `pyeodh`, it is a Python-based tool tailored to facilitate communication with the specific API endpoints exposed by the EODH platform. Using `pyeodh`, developers and scientists can programmatically access the API’s features—such as sending requests, retrieving data, or executing commands—without needing to handle the underlying details such as crafting HTTP requests or managing authentication manually. \n",
    "\n",
    "By abstracting these complexities, 'pyeodh' makes it easier to integrate the API into Python applications, enabling developers to focus on building features rather than managing low-level networking tasks."
