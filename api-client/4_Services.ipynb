    "OGC API refers to a standardised interface defined by the [Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC)(https://ogcapi.ogc.org/) for accessing and sharing geospatial data over the web. These APIs are built on modern web standards, such as HTTP and RESTful principles, to facilitate seamless, interoperable, and efficient access to spatial data and services. By providing a consistent and easy-to-use framework, OGC APIs allow developers, researchers, and organisations to query, retrieve, and analyze geospatial data without being locked into proprietary systems. This is particularly important as it supports interoperability between different platforms, tools, and organizations, enabling collaboration and innovation. OGC APIs play a critical role in breaking down data silos and ensuring that location-based data can be shared across applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Records\n",
    "OGC API - Records is designed for discovering and accessing metadata about geospatial resources. It enables users to search, retrieve, and manage metadata records, such as datasets, services, and other resources. The standard supports flexible query capabilities, filtering, and sorting to help users discover relevant geospatial content efficiently. By adhering to web and open standards, OGC API - Records ensures interoperability across platforms, making it easier for organizations to share and access geospatial metadata in a consistent, machine-readable format. This API service is used on the backend of EODH."
