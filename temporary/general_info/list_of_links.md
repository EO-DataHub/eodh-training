# STAC
* STAC vs ODC from odc-stac site: [readthedocs](https://odc-stac.readthedocs.io/en/latest/stac-vs-odc.html)
* Explanations on the similarities and differences between odc-stac and stackstac: [odc-stac](https://github.com/opendatacube/odc-stac/issues/54),  [Pangeo](https://discourse.pangeo.io/t/comparing-odc-stac-load-and-stackstac-for-raster-composite-workflow/4097/6) - stackstac is slightly simpler to use but needs some awareness around parameterising the data calls
* There's also: [xcube](https://xcube.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview.html) - but I think this is maybe too complex for the user needs
* Another package called: [cubo](https://github.com/ESDS-Leipzig/cubo) - looks like it does a similar thing! 
* stackstac docs: [latest](https://stackstac.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
* An old discussion - 2021 - about STAC use at CEDA: [hosted on Pangeo forums](https://discourse.pangeo.io/t/stac-and-earth-systems-datasets/1472/17)
* Some new user STAC tutorials: [search for STAC](http://www.acgeospatial.co.uk/)
* pystac tutorial: [read a STAC catalog](https://stacspec.org/en/tutorials/1-read-stac-python/) - we will do this using pyeodh

# S3
* Telespazio initial EODH S2 demo: [using boto](https://github.com/UKEODHP/eodhp-guide/blob/main/examples/app-hub/s3demo.ipynb)

# CWL
* My first CWL workflow: [explainer](https://github.com/EO-DataHub/eodh-training/blob/main/temporary/first_workflow.md)

# Workflow ideas
* Could Whitebox be of use in the data processing?: [discussion on Docker availability](https://github.com/jblindsay/whitebox-tools/issues/22), [official docs](https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/whitebox-workflows-for-python/)
