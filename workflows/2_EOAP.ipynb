This is a comprehensive tutorial that introduces the user to different tools (some of which are mentioned elsewhere in these training materials). Much of the tutorial uses hand-crafted code which is generally not recommended as a method of generation (see notes on the [EOAP Generator](3_eoapgen.ipynb) for further details) but in this case it does enable detailed assesment of the different components. A full set of resources are available from the official EOAP Github repository: https://github.com/eoap. Further to this, a related 'hands on' tutorial is available [here](https://github.com/Terradue/ogc-eo-application-package-hands-on).\n",
