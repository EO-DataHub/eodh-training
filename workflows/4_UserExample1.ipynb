    "A requirement to process coherence from Sentinel 1 data was articulated.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Coherence data are a measure of the similarity between two complex radar signals acquired over the same area. In this use case those radar signals are captured by the Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensor using its Single Look Complex (SLC) mode. Coherence is calculated by comparing the phase information of the radar signals across consecutive or closely spaced acquisitions. High coherence indicates strong similarity in phase, which typically occurs when the surface properties remain stable between acquisitions, such as in urban areas or bare soil. Conversely, low coherence suggests changes in the surface, such as vegetation growth, soil moisture variations, or physical displacement caused by events such as earthquakes or landslides. The coherence value, ranging between 0 and 1, provides valuable information about the temporal stability of the observed area.\n",
    "\n",
    "Coherence data derived from Sentinel-1 SLC imagery are crucial in various remote sensing applications, including land-use classification, vegetation monitoring, and deformation analysis. In particular, coherence is a key component of interferometric SAR (InSAR) techniques, which rely on phase differences to measure ground displacement with millimeter precision. Coherence can be used to monitor dynamic changes in the environment, such as detecting deforestation, tracking agricultural practices, or studying snow cover variations. By leveraging Sentinel-1's high spatial resolution, regular revisit times, and all-weather imaging capabilities, coherence data provide a robust tool for understanding and managing natural and human-induced changes on the Earth's surface.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"The Sentinel 1 Level 1 SLC products are images in the slant range by azimuth imaging plane, in the image plane of satellite data acquisition. Each image pixel is represented by a complex (I and Q) magnitude value and therefore contains both amplitude and phase information. Each I and Q value is 16 bits per pixel. The processing for all SLC products results in a single look in each dimension using the full available signal bandwidth. The imagery is geo-referenced using orbit and attitude data from the satellite.\" [ref](https://documentation.dataspace.copernicus.eu/Data/SentinelMissions/Sentinel1.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "Information on Sentinel 1 and the different products that are available at source can be found on the Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem (CDSE) [website](https://dataspace.copernicus.eu/explore-data/data-collections/sentinel-data/sentinel-1) and [here](https://documentation.dataspace.copernicus.eu/Data/SentinelMissions/Sentinel1.html)"

    "Before creating a workflow on the EODH platform it was important to step through the scientific process to make sure that the correct tools and data were being considered. To create the coherence outputs we use a relatively new Python package called [eo-tools](https://eo-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) which calls another powerful packaged called [pygmtsar](https://github.com/AlexeyPechnikov/pygmtsar) (see also [https://insar.dev/](https://insar.dev/)).\n",

This will generate an image of coherence in the project path set earlier in the Notebook. To effectively set the remainder of the parameters you will need some level of competence in SAR interferometry. For the purposes of this demonstration we leave them on the default values."

Commercial Airbus Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, such as those from the TerraSAR-X or TanDEM-X missions, can be used to generate coherence products by leveraging their high-resolution and high-quality Single Look Complex (SLC) imagery. These Airbus supplied SAR data provide precise orbital control and excellent temporal and spatial resolution, which are critical for ensuring accurate phase comparisons. By processing pairs of TerraSAR-X or TanDEM-X images, coherence maps can be derived to assess temporal stability and surface dynamics. Additionally, the fine spatial resolution of Airbus SAR data enhances the detail and accuracy of coherence products, making them particularly valuable for localized studies and detailed environmental or industrial assessments.\n",
