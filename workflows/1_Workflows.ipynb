    "The WR is a required component of the Hub designed to interprate CWL files and ensure that the algorithms wrapped within them are sensibly scaled across the available infrastructure. In the case of the EODH, the infrastructure is a Kubernetes cluster running on an AWS backend, but this is not a hard-set requirement. \n",

    "The guidance around EOAPs is that handcrafting a package is possible but not recommended. These workflows can become very complex very quickly and it is recommended that some form of tooling is used to automate or semi-automate the generation of an EOAP. As part of the Pathfinder phase of the project, the EODH (via a 3rd party contractor, Oxidian) has created eoap-gen to help specialist technicians to create service workflows. "
