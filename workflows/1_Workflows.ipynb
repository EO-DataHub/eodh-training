    "<p style=\"text-align:center;\"> In the context of the EODH, what is a workflow? </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the terminology of the EODH, a workflow is a file written in CWL (the Common Workflow Language) that creates a data processing chain. However, this CWL file only provides the orchestration of a wider set of tools that are brought together as an entity known as an Earth Observation Application Package (EOAP)."

    "\n",
    "The WR is a required component of the Hub designed to interprate CWL files and ensure that the algorithms wrapped within them are sensibly scaled across the available infrastructure. In the case of the EODH, the infrastructure is a Kubernetes cluster running on an AWS backend, but this is not a hard-set requirement. \n",
    "\n",
    "The WR itself is a piece of software called ADES. If you want to understand the internal components of the WR then the ADES Design Document is avialable here: https://eoepca.github.io/proc-ades/master/. \n",
    "\n",
    "The use is that EOAPs can be transfered from platform to platform e.g. they could be developed on EODH and run on EOEPCA or the other way round. Platforms run by DLR and NASA also utilise EOAPs and procesisng algorithms can be shared between them.  \n",

    "\n",
    " ADES is responsible for the execution of the processing service through both a OGC WPS 1.0 & 2.0 OWS service and an OGC Processes REST API. The processing request are executed within the target Exploitation Platform (i.e., the one that is close to the data).\n",
    "\n",
    "The ADES software uses ZOO-Project as the main framework for exposing the OGC compliant web services. The ZOO-kernel powering the web services is included in the software package.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ADES functions are designed to perform the processing and chaining function on a Kubernetes cluster using the Calrissian Tool. Calrissian uses CWL, that is a robust workflow engine, over Kubernetes that enables the implementation of each step in a workflow as a container. It provides simple, flexible mechanisms for specifying constraints between the steps in a workflow and artifact management for linking the output of any step as an input to subsequent steps."

    "### Why CWL?\n",
    "While shell scripts or other code scripts (e.g. Python) can meet the need of data processing workflows, using a formal workflow language (such as CWL) brings additional benefits such as abstraction and improved scalability and portability. \n",
    "\n",
    "Computational workflows explicitly create a divide between a userâ€™s dataflow and the computational details which underpin the chain of tools. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataflow is described by the workflow and the tool implementation is specified by descriptors that remove the workflow complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Workflow managers such as `cwltool` help with the automation, monitoring and tracking of a dataflow. By producing computational workflows in a standardised format, and publishing them (alongside any data) with open access, the workflows become more FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable). The Common Workflow Language (CWL) standard has been developed to standardise workflow needs across different thematic areas.\n",

These workflows can become very complex very quickly and it is recommended that some form of tooling is used to automate or semi-automate the generation of an EOAP. As part of the Pathfinder phase of the project, the EODH (via a 3rd party contractor, Oxidian) has created eoap-gen to help specialist technicians to create service workflows. "

    "The first thing to do when designing a workflow is understand the context of what is desired, and how that may need to be referred to in the workflow. For this example workflow, we will take a list of Sentinel-2 ARD images, clip them to an area of interest, and stack them. The flow will look like the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```mermaid\n",

    "  get_data -- S2_ARD --> clip -- clipped --> stack -- stacked--> Output ;\n",

    "\n",
    "The next thing to do is access the data to be used in the Workflow. In this case we will download two bands of a Sentinel 2 image held on AWS. We will use the [curl](https://curl.se/) tool to do this, saving the accessed image as `B0$.tif` (where $ is the band number):\n",
