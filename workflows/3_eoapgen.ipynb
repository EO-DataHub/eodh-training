    "* create a STAC output of the processed data. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the `eoap-gen` tool these steps will always be required and when using the workflow runner (WR) (aka ADES) on the EODH the output will always need to be a directory output containing a STAC catalog. When using the EODH it is recommended that the Python API client `pyeodh` is used to access the API endpoints on the Hub. \n",

It is a commandline tool designed to run locally and is an excellent piece of software to help check that CWL is compliant. It is designed for use on Linux and will also run on a Mac or Windows (through WSL - windows Subsystem for Linux).
