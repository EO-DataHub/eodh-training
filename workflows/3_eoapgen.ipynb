    "* process your input data, and \n",
    "* create a STAC output of the processed data. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the `eoap-gen` tool these steps will always be required and when using the workflow runner (WR) (aka ADES) on the EODH the output will always need to be a directory output containing a STAC catalog. When using the EODH it is recommended that the Python API client `pyeodh` is used to access the API endpoints on the Hub. \n",
