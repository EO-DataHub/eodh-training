    "A major benefit derived from constructing the EODH platform using open components is that the technologies and tools can integrate with existing third-party software. One useful pre-existing QGIS plugin is the [STAC API Browser](https://stacspec.org/en/tutorials/2-intro-to-stac-api-browser-qgis-plugin/). The STAC API Browser is the defacto way of finding and interacting with STAC catalogues on the internet.  \n",

    "Use this URL in the STAC API Browser plugin (https://test.eodatahub.org.uk/api/catalogue/stac/catalogs/supported-datasets/ceda-stac-catalogue/) to find assets accessible through the EODH Resource Catalogue (RC). \n",

    "![](../img/SAB2.png){width=700px}\n",
    "\n",
    "One useful aspect of this plugin is to plot the returned item boundaries, as shown below. It is also possible to access specific item assets i.e. the data, but this can be very slow given the size of the assets themselves. It is recommended that a tool such as `pyeodh` or the EODH web interface is used to directly access the datasets referenced by the catalogues.  \n",
