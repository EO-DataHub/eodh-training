This is a UI hosted on the Hub website that allows users to interface with EODH and manage their user account. From here API keys can be generated and managed, and the AppHub and Resource Catalogue can be accessed. "

It is a collection of STAC catalogues ([click for more information regarding STAC](https://stacspec.org/en/)) that can be searched visually via the Web Presence or programatically via clients such as `pyeodh`. There are a series of fully open public resources, commercial resources that point towards an ordering service and private workspace resources. A complex resource access system manages this on the back-end.  "

It also allows the creation of scientific analytical workflows and associated data processing. Once logged in to the AppHub a user is able to upload notebooks and data, or create new notebooks, from where they can interact with other EODH components using tools such as `pyeodh`.\n",

    "There are ways of creating Virtual Environments in JupyterHub and instructions for that can be found [here](https://help.jasmin.ac.uk/docs/interactive-computing/creating-a-virtual-environment-in-the-notebooks-service/). It's also possible to do the same thing using [conda](https://help.jasmin.ac.uk/docs/interactive-computing/creating-a-virtual-environment-in-the-notebooks-service/#can-i-use-conda-instead-of-a-virtual-environment). This can be particularly helpful when trying to run specific packages that need their own environment."

    "# Workflow Runner\n",
    "The workflow runner (WR) is a component that the majority of users will not have direct access to but which will be important to any process looking to scale up data processing to generate a data service. Advanced technical users (ideally with some dev-ops experience) will be able to create workflows that run on the WR. However, all users will be able to submit publically available workflows to their workspace and run them, either via the AppHub, `pyeodh` or QGIS."
