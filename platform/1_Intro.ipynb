    "# EODH Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The overall goal of the Earth Observation Data Hub (EODH) project is to develop and operate a new centralised software infrastructure – the Hub – to provide a ‘single point’ of access for UK Earth Observation (EO) data obtained from distributed sources, to include public and commercial centres.  \n",
    "\n",
    "By providing this single point of access, the objective is to provide a standard common set of services and APIs upon which new EO services and tools can be developed and accessed by the UK EO data community. The project is currently in a Pathfinder phase (2023-2025) that brings new thinking and experimental developments to bear, resulting in practical services for a variety of users in a short period of time. \n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of the pathfinder phase (March 2025), it is expected that there will be a community of researchers, industry and government users working together to provide and intereact with EO data in new and innovative ways. "

    "* a GIS user who spends most of their working time in QGIS\n",
    "* a web application developer, interested in hooking into the processing power of the EODH and the associated datasets\n",
    "* a data scientist, who will use code in a Jupyter notebook to process different spatial datasets\n",
    "* a dev-ops specialist, tasked with creating and maintaining data services hosted on the EODH\n",
